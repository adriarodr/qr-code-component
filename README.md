### What I learned

During the challenge, I realized that screen readers couldn’t interpret the QR code on the website directly. So, my solution was to add a corresponding anchor that would take users to the same link when clicked on instead of relying solely on the QR code. Additionally, I added text within the paragraph that the user can use a QR code or link on the code to go to Frontend Mentor’s home page. Next, I made the link and additional text visually hidden by following CSS Tricks' visually hidden styling rule. While this challenge was simple, I was conscious of accessibility and what items I must implement to ensure the content makes sense to everyone.
